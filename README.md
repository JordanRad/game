# Quiz game app

## Case
This project was part of job application interview long time ago. The task inspired me to make fully working quiz application with intersting questions. I started implementing the project immediately. By now it has a stable working version which includes working quiz with 15 questions and 3 helpers. Every single question has only one right answer and the questions are separated in three categories in terms of difficulty 5 of each (*easy*, *medium*, *hard*). In terms of topics, they are a variety of quietions on different topics.

You can see the deployed quiz app [**here**](https://clever-turing-f884e5.netlify.app/).
